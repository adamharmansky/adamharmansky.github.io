# PAST SIMPLE

## Form

 - positive: I played tennis yesterday
 - negative: Jane didn't visit her friends last week
 - question: Did you travel to London last year

**be careful with all the irregular verbs**

 - positive: Tom ran 2 miles yesterday in the morning
 - negative: Jane didn't run too fast yesterday because she was too tired
 - question: Did the students run at the elementary school at PE

## spelling

 - *arrive/arrived*: verbs ending in –e add –d: phone/phone
 - *wait/waited*: verbs not ending in –e add –ed: ask/asked, follow/followed
 - *stop/stopped*: verbs spelt with a single vowel letter followed by a single consonant letter double the consonant: beg/begged, rub/rubbed
 - *cry/cried*: when there is a consonant before –y, they change to -i before we add –ed: carry/carried, deny/denied, try/tried,but compare!!! play/played, delay/delayed which have a vowel before –y and therefore simply add –ed in the past

**doubling** occurs wherever a vowel meets a consonant **except for** *happened* lmoa


## Use
- we normally use the simple past tense to talk about events, actions or situations which occurred in the past and are now finished = COMPLETED ACTIONS
e.g. *Sam phoned a moment ago.* / *I saw Fred in town when I was there this morning.* / *I never met my grandfather because he is dead*

 - we use it when we are usually concerned with when an action occurred, not with its duration (how long it lasted) When did it happen?
 - past habit: like USED TO

> *Tom used to do the sport every day when he lived in the countryside.* / *Tom didn't use to run every day.* / *Did he use to play football?*

> *Tom did the sport every day when he lived in the countryside.*

- we can sometimes use the simple past without a time reference to describe something that happened a very short time ago

> *Did the telephone ring?*

> *Who left the door open?*

- it can be used also for polite inquiries = asking for favour, so it doesn't refer to past time

> *I wonder if you could give me a lift./ I wondered if you could give me a lift*

## Adverbials with the simple past tense:
 - typical adverbials like: **YESTERDAY**, **LAST** **SUMMER**, combinations with **AGO** = back from now
 - it is often used with **WHEN** to ask and answer **WH**- questions
 - e.g. When did you learn about it?/ When I saw it in the papers.
 - other adverbials can be used  when they refer to past time
 - e.g. adverbs: always, often, ever/ prepositional phrases: at 4 o'clock, in July, adverbial clauses/ as + adverb + as (as recently as)

# PAST CONTINUOUS

## Form
 - to be in the past = **WAS**/**WERE** + **VERB** - ING
 - positive: *I was playing the piano all the afternoon yesterday.*
 - negative: *He wasn't watching the TV while I was cooking.*
 - question: *What were you doing last weekend?*



## Use
 - we use the past continuous to describe the past situations or actions that were in progress at some time in the past
 - e.g. *I was living abroad in 1987, so I missed the general election.*
 - often we don't know whether the action was completed or not

> *Jane was working on her essay last night.*

 - adverbials beginning with **ALL** emphasize the continuity

> *It was raining all night/ all yesterday/ all the afternoon.*

 - we use it for actions which began before something else happened: the past progressive describes a situation or action in progress in the past, and the simple past describes  a shorter action or event, the action in progress is often introduced by conjunctions like **WHEN**/ **AS**/ **JUST AS**/ **WHILE**

> *Just as I was leaving the house, the phone rang./ Jane met Frank Sinatra when she was living in Hollywood./ We were having supper when the phone rang.*

\newpage

 - **PROGRESSIVE FORM** puts more emphasis on the duration of the action
 - e.g. While I was walking at the street, someone stole my wallet.
 - **PARALLEL ACTIONS**: we can emphasize the fact that 2 or more actions were in progress at the same time by using while or at the time
 - e.g. While I was cooking, my friend was working in the garden.
 - **REPEATED ACTIONS**: e.g. When he worked here, Roger was always making mistakes.
 - **POLITE INQUIRIES**: it is more polite like past simple
 - e.g. I was wondering if you could give me a lift.

## SUMMARY

We use the past tenses when we are talking or writing about the past. Past continuous is used for scene-setting. They are used in story-telling, biography, autobiography, reports, eye-witness accounts...

# PAST PERFECT SIMPLE

## Form

**HAD + PAST PARTICIPLE (E.G. I HAD DONE)**

 - positive: *I had arrived to the airport before my friend came to wait me.*
 - negative: *Tom hadn't written the letter before he went to the office.*
 - question: *Had you waited at the railway station for a long time when I came?*

## Use

It is sometimes supposed that we use the past perfect simply to describe events that happened a long time ago
it refers to an earlier past:

 - the main use of the past perfect is to show which of the two events happened first
   - e.g. *The patient died.* *The doctor arrived.*/ The patient died when the doctor arrived. (= the patient died at the time or just after the doctor arrived)
   - e.g. *The patient had died when the doctor arrived.* (= the patient was already dead when the doctor arrived)
### Typical Conjunctions
They refer to an earlier past:
 - **WHEN**, **AFTER**, **AS** **SOON AS**, **BY THE TIME THAT**, adverbs often associated with the present perfect **ALREADY**, **EVER**, **FOR**, **JUST**, **NEVER**, **NEVER** ... **BEFORE**, **SINCE**

> *We cleared up as soon as our guests had left.*

> *When I rang, Jim had already left.*

> *The boys loved the zoo. They had never seen wild animals before.*

 - it is often used as the past form of the present perfect – this is typical in the case of **indirect speech**, e.g.:

> *Julie is excited because she has never been to a dance before.*

> *Julie was excited because she had never been to a dance before.*

 - **YET** can be used with the past perfect but we often prefer expressions like **UNTIL THEN**, **BY THAT TIME**, e.g:

> *He hasn't finished yet.*

> *He hadn't finished by yesterday evening.*

 - **it is used for unfulfilled hopes and wishes** - to describe something that we hoped or wished to do but didn‘t

>  *I had hoped to send him a telegram to congratulate him on his marriage, but I didn't manage it.*
