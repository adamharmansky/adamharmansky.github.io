# PAST SIMPLE

## Form

 - positive: I played tennis yesterday
 - negative: Jane didn't visit her friends last week
 - question: Did you travel to London last year

**be careful with all the irregular verbs**

 - positive: Tom ran 2 miles yesterday in the morning
 - negative: Jane didn't run too fast yesterday because she was too tired
 - question: Did the students run at the elementary school at PE

## spelling

 - *arrive/arrived*: verbs ending in –e add –d: phone/phone
 - *wait/waited*: verbs not ending in –e add –ed: ask/asked, follow/followed
 - *stop/stopped*: verbs spelt with a single vowel letter followed by a single consonant letter double the consonant: beg/begged, rub/rubbed
 - *cry/cried*: when there is a consonant before –y, they change to -i before we add –ed: carry/carried, deny/denied, try/tried,but compare!!! play/played, delay/delayed which have a vowel before –y and therefore simply add –ed in the past

**doubling** occurs wherever a vowel meets a consonant **except for** *happened* lmoa


## Use
- we normally use the simple past tense to talk about events, actions or situations which occurred in the past and are now finished = COMPLETED ACTIONS
e.g. *Sam phoned a moment ago.* / *I saw Fred in town when I was there this morning.* / *I never met my grandfather because he is dead*

 - we use it when we are usually concerned with when an action occurred, not with its duration (how long it lasted) When did it happen?
 - past habit: like USED TO
e.g. *Tom used to do the sport every day when he lived in the countryside.* / *Tom didn’t use to run every day.* / *Did he use to play football?*
e.g. *Tom did the sport every day when he lived in the countryside.*

- we can sometimes use the simple past without a time reference to describe something that happened a very short time ago
e.g. *Did the telephone ring?* / *Who left the door open?*

- it can be used also for polite inquiries = asking for favour, so it doesn’t refer to past tim
e.g. I wonder if you could give me a lift./ I wondered if you could give me a lift

## Adverbials with the simple past tense:
 - typical adverbials like: **YESTERDAY**, **LAST** **SUMMER**, combinations with **AGO** = back from now
 - it is often used with **WHEN** to ask and answer **WH**- questions
 - e.g. When did you learn about it?/ When I saw it in the papers.
 - other adverbials can be used  when they refer to past time
 - e.g. adverbs: always, often, ever/ prepositional phrases: at 4 o’clock, in July, adverbial clauses/ as + adverb + as (as recently as)

# PAST CONTINUOUS

## Form
 - to be in the past = **WAS**/**WERE** + **VERB** - ING
 - positive: *I was playing the piano all the afternoon yesterday.*
 - negative: *He wasn’t watching the TV while I was cooking.*
 - question: *What were you doing last weekend?*



## Use
 - we use the past continuous to describe the past situations or actions that were in progress at some time in the past
 - e.g. *I was living abroad in 1987, so I missed the general election.*
 - often we don’t know whether the action was completed or not
 - e.g. *Jane was working on her essay last night.*
 - adverbials beginning with **ALL** emphasize the continuity
 - e.g. *It was raining all night/ all yesterday/ all the afternoon.*
 - we use it for actions which began before something else happened: the past progressive describes a situation or action in progress in the past, and the simple past describes  a shorter action or event, the action in progress is often introduced by conjunctions like **WHEN**/ **AS**/ **JUST AS**/ **WHILE**
 - e.g. *Just as I was leaving the house, the phone rang./ Jane met Frank Sinatra when she was living in Hollywood./ We were having supper when the phone rang.*

\newpage

 - **PROGRESSIVE FORM** puts more emphasis on the duration of the action
 - e.g. While I was walking at the street, someone stole my wallet.
 - **PARALLEL ACTIONS**: we can emphasize the fact that 2 or more actions were in progress at the same time by using while or at the time
 - e.g. While I was cooking, my friend was working in the garden.
 - **REPEATED ACTIONS**: e.g. When he worked here, Roger was always making mistakes.
 - **POLITE INQUIRIES**: it is more polite like past simple
 - e.g. I was wondering if you could give me a lift.
